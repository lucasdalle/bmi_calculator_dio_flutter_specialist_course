## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to develop a simple **Dart** application capable of calculating a person's **BMI (Body Mass Index)**, applying good programming practices and proper data validation.  
To achieve this, the project aims to:

- **Model a `Person` class** containing:
  - Name
  - Weight
  - Height
  - Health status
- **Read user input from the terminal**, ensuring a simple and direct interaction.
- **Handle exceptions** to prevent failures from invalid inputs.
- **Implement the BMI calculation** using the standard formula.
- **Display the result and classification** in a clear and user-friendly way.
- **Create automated tests** to validate business rules and ensure code reliability.
